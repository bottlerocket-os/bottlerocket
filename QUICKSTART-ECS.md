[Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)](https://ecs.aws) is a highly scalable, fast container management service that makes it easy to run, stop, and manage containers on a cluster.
Your containers are defined in a task definition which you use to run individual tasks or as a service.

This quickstart will walk through setting up an Amazon ECS cluster with Bottlerocket container instances (using the EC2 launch type).
Check out the [Amazon ECS developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html) for an overview of ECS.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, be sure that you've completed the steps in
[Setting up with Amazon ECS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/get-set-up-for-amazon-ecs.html)
and that your AWS user has either the [`AdministratorAccess`](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess) policy
or the permissions specified in the [Amazon ECS First Run Wizard Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html#first-run-permissions) IAM policy example.

You'll also need [aws-cli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) set up to interact with AWS.


## Create a cluster

An Amazon ECS cluster is a logical grouping of tasks, services, and container instances.
For more information about clusters, see
[Amazon ECS clusters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/clusters.html).

You can create a cluster with the AWS CLI as follows:

```
aws ecs --region us-west-2 create-cluster --cluster-name bottlerocket
```

> Note: The command above and subsequent examples include the AWS region, so change it from `us-west-2` if you operate in another region.

## Finding an AMI

You can either use an official AMI provided by Amazon or build an AMI yourself using
[our guide](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket/blob/develop/BUILDING.md).

The official AMI IDs are stored in
[public SSM parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/parameter-store-public-parameters.html).
To find the `aws-ecs-1` variant for the `x86_64` architecture in the `us-west-2` region, you can use the following command:

```
aws ssm get-parameter --region us-west-2 --name "/aws/service/bottlerocket/aws-ecs-1/x86_64/latest/image_id" --query Parameter.Value --output text
```

If you have `jq` and would like a bit more information, try this:

```
aws ssm get-parameters --region us-west-2 \
   --names "/aws/service/bottlerocket/aws-ecs-1/x86_64/latest/image_id" \
           "/aws/service/bottlerocket/aws-ecs-1/x86_64/latest/image_version" \
   --output json | jq -r '.Parameters | .[] | "\(.Name): \(.Value) (updated \(.LastModifiedDate | gmtime | strftime("%c")) UTC)"'
```

You can replace the architecture (`x86_64`) and region (`us-west-2`) to look for other images.
If you know a specific Bottlerocket version you'd like to use, you can replace `latest` with that version.

You can also see all available parameters
[through the web console](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/parameters/#list_parameter_filters=Path:Recursive:%2Faws%2Fservice%2Fbottlerocket).

## Launching your first instance

In order to launch a Bottlerocket instance into your ECS cluster, you'll first need some information about the resources in your AWS account.

### Subnet info

You should either have a default virtual private cloud (VPC) or have already
[created a VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/get-set-up-for-amazon-ecs.html#create-a-vpc)
in your account.

To find your default VPC, run this command.
(If you use an AWS region other than "us-west-2", make sure to change that.)

```
aws ec2 describe-vpcs \
   --region us-west-2 \
   --filters=Name=isDefault,Values=true \
   | jq --raw-output '.Vpcs[].VpcId'
```

If you want to use a different VPC you created, run this to get the ID for your VPC.
Make sure to change VPC_NAME to the name of the VPC you created.
(If you use an EC2 region other than "us-west-2", make sure to change that too.)

```
aws ec2 describe-vpcs \
   --region us-west-2 \
   --filters=Name=tag:Name,Values=VPC_NAME \
   | jq --raw-output '.Vpcs[].VpcId'
```

Next, run this to get information about the subnets in your VPC.
It will give you a list of the subnets and tell you whether each is public or private.
Make sure to change VPC_ID to the value you received from the previous command.
(If you use an EC2 region other than "us-west-2", make sure to change that too.)

```
aws ec2 describe-subnets \
   --region us-west-2 \
   --filter=Name=vpc-id,Values=VPC_ID \
   | jq '.Subnets[] | {id: .SubnetId, public: .MapPublicIpOnLaunch, az: .AvailabilityZone}'
```

You'll want to pick one and save it for the launch command later.

You can choose whether you want public or private.
* Choose private for production deployments to get maximum isolation of instances.
* Choose public to more easily debug your instance.
  These subnets have an Internet Gateway, so if you add a public IP address to your instance, you can talk to it.
  (You can manually add an Internet Gateway to a private subnet later, so this is a reversible decision.)

Note that if you choose to use the public subnet, you'll need your instance to have a publicly accessible IP address.
That either means adding `--associate-public-ip-address` to the launch command below, or attaching an Elastic IP address after launch.
There will be a reminder about this when we talk about the launch command.

Finally, note that if you want to launch in a specific availability zone, make sure you pick a subnet that matches; the AZ is listed right below the public/private status.

### IAM role

The instance we launch needs to be associated with an IAM role that allows for communication with ECS.

ECS provides a
[managed policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_managed_policies.html#AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role)
with all of the appropriate permissions.
If you've used ECS before, you may already have an appropriate role in your account called `ecsInstanceRole`.
If you do not, you can
[follow the instructions in the ECS Developer Guide to create a role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/instance_IAM_role.html).

Note down the instance role name in your account for the instructions below.

#### Enabling SSM

If you add SSM permissions, you can use Bottlerocket's default SSM agent to get a shell session on the instance.

To attach the role policy for SSM permissions, run the following (replacing INSTANCE_ROLE_NAME with the name of your instance role):

```
aws iam attach-role-policy \
   --role-name INSTANCE_ROLE_NAME \
   --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore
```

**Note:** The instance also need permission to access ECR repository where [default control container](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-control-container) live; the appropriate policy to add to INSTANCE_ROLE_NAME role is `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly`

Next, to retrieve the instance profile name used to launch instances, run this:

```
aws iam list-instance-profiles-for-role --role-name INSTANCE_ROLE_NAME --query "InstanceProfiles[*].InstanceProfileName" --output text
```

Note this down as the INSTANCE_PROFILE_NAME for the final launch command.

### Connecting to your cluster

For the instance to be able to communicate with ECS, we need to make sure to configure the instance with the name of the cluster.

Create a file called `userdata.toml` with the following contents, where CLUSTER_NAME is the name of the cluster you created above (for example, "bottlerocket").

```
[settings.ecs]
cluster = "CLUSTER_NAME"
```

If you want to customize the behavior of your instance further, you can find the full set of supported settings [here](README.md#settings).

### Launch!

Now we can launch a Bottlerocket instance in our cluster!

There are a few values to make sure you change in this command:
* YOUR_KEY_NAME: your SSH keypair name, as registered with EC2
* SUBNET_ID: the subnet you selected earlier
  * If you chose a public subnet, either add `--associate-public-ip-address` to the command, or attach an Elastic IP afterward.
* BOTTLEROCKET_AMI_ID: the Amazon-provided AMI ID you found above, or the ID of an AMI you registered
* userdata.toml: the path to the user data file you created earlier
* INSTANCE_PROFILE_NAME: the IAM instance profile you created, e.g. `ecsInstanceRole`

```
aws ec2 run-instances --key-name YOUR_KEY_NAME \
   --subnet-id SUBNET_ID \
   --image-id BOTTLEROCKET_AMI_ID \
   --instance-type c3.large \
   --region us-west-2 \
   --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=instance,Tags=[{Key=bottlerocket,Value=quickstart}]' \
   --user-data file://userdata.toml \
   --iam-instance-profile Name=INSTANCE_PROFILE_NAME
```

And remember, if you used a public subnet, add `--associate-public-ip-address` or attach an Elastic IP after launch.

Once it launches, you should be able to run tasks on your Bottlerocket instance using the ECS API and console.
