Subject: [PATCH] sysctl: do not set rp_filter via wildcard

The wildcard matches existing interfaces when `systemd-sysctl` runs
at startup, but also applies to new interfaces when it is invoked by
a udev rule in `99-systemd.rules`.

This effectively makes `net.ipv4.conf.default` useless for setting a
default value for rp_filter, since the wildcard will also match and
clobber the value.

It also interferes with CNI plugins that attempt to configure the
rp_filter value for newly created interfaces.
