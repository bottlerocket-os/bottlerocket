Subject: [PATCH] linux-firmware: bt/wifi: Remove firmware for Bluetooth/WiFi
 devices

Bottlerocket does not configure any drivers for Bluetooth or WiFi
devices. Without the drivers the firmware is useless and does not need
to be shipped. The following list matches driver names as listed in
WHENCE to the kernel config options enabling those driver in case we do
add drivers in the future we can easily check if we need to add firmware
binaries.

-    These firmware should be put under /lib/firmware/rtw88/
-    And note that the rtw88 driver is able to support wake-on-wireless LAN
-    for RTL8822C devices, after kernel v5.6+. So, make sure the firmware
-    rtw88/rtw8822c_wow_fw.bin is also packed, otherwise the firmware load
-    fail could be a problem.
-    Although RTL8723D devices are 802.11n device, they are also supported
-    by rtw88 because the hardware arch is similar.
