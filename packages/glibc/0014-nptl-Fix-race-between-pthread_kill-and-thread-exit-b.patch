Subject: [PATCH 14/26] nptl: Fix race between pthread_kill and thread exit
 (bug 12889)

A new thread exit lock and flag are introduced.  They are used to
detect that the thread is about to exit or has exited in
__pthread_kill_internal, and the signal is not sent in this case.

The test sysdeps/pthread/tst-pthread_cancel-select-loop.c is derived
from a downstream test originally written by Marek Polacek.
