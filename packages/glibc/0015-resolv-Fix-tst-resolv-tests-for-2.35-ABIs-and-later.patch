Subject: [PATCH 15/28] resolv: Fix tst-resolv tests for 2.35 ABIs and later

The commit 737e873b30 ("resolv: Do not build libanl.so for ABIs starting
at 2.35") disabled building libanl for ports supporting only 2.35 and
later like OpenRISC.

However, the if statement was not updated quite correctly and the change
ends up disabling many tst-resolv* tests.  This was not supposed to be
done and it causes test dependency errors like:

     make: Entering directory 'gnu-home/glibc/resolv'
     make: *** No rule to make target 'gnu-home/build-glibc/resolv/tst-resolv-res_ninit.out', needed by 'gnu-home/build-glibc/resolv/mtrace-tst-resolv-res_ninit.out'. Stop.
     make: Leaving directory 'gnu-home/glibc/resolv'

This patch move the extra-libs += libanl definition and condition down
to be closer to other libanl definitions.  The $(have-GLIBC_2.34)
condition now includes libanl-routines and libanl-shared-only-routines as
well.

Also, I have added a comment to endif of $(have-thread-library) to help
show the bondary of the have-thread-library definitions.
