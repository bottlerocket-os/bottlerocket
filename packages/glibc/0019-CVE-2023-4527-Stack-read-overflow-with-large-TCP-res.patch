Subject: [PATCH] CVE-2023-4527: Stack read overflow with large TCP responses
 in no-aaaa mode

Without passing alt_dns_packet_buffer, __res_context_search can only
store 2048 bytes (what fits into dns_packet_buffer).  However,
the function returns the total packet size, and the subsequent
DNS parsing code in _nss_dns_gethostbyname4_r reads beyond the end
of the stack-allocated buffer.

Fixes commit f282cdbe7f436c75864e5640a4 ("resolv: Implement no-aaaa
stub resolver option") and bug 30842.

(cherry picked from commit bd77dd7e73e3530203be1c52c8a29d08270cb25d)

 Version 2.38.1
 
+Security related changes:
+
+  CVE-2023-4527: If the system is configured in no-aaaa mode via
+  /etc/resolv.conf, getaddrinfo is called for the AF_UNSPEC address
+  family, and a DNS response is received over TCP that is larger than
+  2048 bytes, getaddrinfo may potentially disclose stack contents via
+  the returned address data, or crash.
+
 The following bugs are resolved with this release:
 
   [30723] posix_memalign repeatedly scans long bin lists
   [30785] Always call destructors in reverse constructor order
   [30804] F_GETLK, F_SETLK, and F_SETLKW value change for powerpc64 with
     -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64
+  [30842] Stack read overflow in getaddrinfo in no-aaaa mode (CVE-2023-4527)
