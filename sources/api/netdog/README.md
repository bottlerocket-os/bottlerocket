# netdog

Current version: 0.1.0

## Introduction

netdog is a small helper program for wicked, to apply network settings received from DHCP.  It
generates `/etc/resolv.conf`, generates and sets the hostname, and persists the current IP to a
file.

It contains two subcommands meant for use as settings generators:
* `node-ip`: returns the node's current IP address in JSON format
* `generate-hostname`: returns the node's hostname in JSON format. If the lookup is unsuccessful, the IP of the node is used.

The subcommand `set-hostname` sets the hostname for the system.

The subcommand `generate-net-config` generates the network interface configuration for the host. If
a `net.toml` file exists in `/var/lib/bottlerocket`, it is used to generate the configuration. If
`net.toml` doesn't exist, the kernel command line `/proc/cmdline` is checked for the prefix
`netdog.default-interface`.  If an interface is defined with that prefix, it is used to generate an
interface configuration.  A single default interface may be defined on the kernel command line with
the format: `netdog.default-interface=interface-name:option1,option2`.  "interface-name" is the
name of the interface, and valid options are "dhcp4" and "dhcp6".  A "?" may be added to the option
to signify that the lease for the protocol is optional and the system shouldn't wait for it.  A
valid example: `netdog.default-interface=eno1:dhcp4,dhcp6?`.

The subcommand `validate-net-config` takes a path to a network interface configuration file. Rather
than generate the configuration like `generate-net-config`, it only parses the file and prints very
basic information about the found configuration or the error found while attempting to parse the
file. This command is intended to be run by a user to test network configuration files.

The subcommand `write-resolv-conf` writes the resolv.conf, favoring DNS API settings and
supplementing any missing settings with DNS settings from the primary interface's DHCP lease.  It
is meant to be used as a restart command for DNS API settings.
