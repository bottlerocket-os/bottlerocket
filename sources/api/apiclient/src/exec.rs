//! The 'exec' module lets you run a command in another container through the apiserver.  A
//! WebSocket is used for communication with the server.  Process input and output is sent back and
//! forth directly through a binary channel, and control messages are sent through a multiplexed
//! text channel.

// Implementation note: the main job of this module is managing communication to and from the
// server through a WebSocket.  This is accomplished mainly with threads and channels - a thread is
// started to manage each particular resource, like input, output, signals, heartbeat, etc.  If it
// needs to send messages to the server, it's given a channel to the server.  If the caller needs to
// hear back from the thread, it's given back a channel.
//
// This behavior is encapsulated in structs.  For example, there's a Heartbeat struct; you create
// it and give it a channel it can use to send to the server, it starts a thread, and you get back
// the struct, which contains a channel that tells you if the heartbeat dies.
