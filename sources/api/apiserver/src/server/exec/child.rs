//! The 'child' module owns the child process for an exec request, and provides handles for the
//! caller to communicate with the process.
//!
//! The process is spawned into the namespaces of an existing container (task) using containerd;
//! the desired container and command are given by the caller.  We can also optionally create a PTY
//! for the task to run in, useful for interactive programs.  Process output is sent back as actor
//! messages, and process input is received on a channel.

// Implementation note: the main job of this module is communicating with the child process.  We
// use simple blocking calls for communication, so we organize the module with threads and
// channels.  A thread is started to manage each type of communication, like reading, writing,
// waiting for exit, etc.  When we need to send messages to the WebSocket actor, like for sending
// process output or return code, we're given its actor address.  When we need to receive ongoing
// messages from the WebSocket actor, like for process input, we create and hand back a channel.
//
// This behavior is encapsulated in structs.  For example, there's a WriteToChild struct; you
// create it and give it the actor address it can use to send (capacity updates) to the client, it
// starts a thread, and you get back the struct, which contains the channel where you dump user
// input.
