//! The 'exec' module lets clients run a command in another container.  We spawn the requested
//! command through containerd and use a WebSocket for communication with the client.  Process
//! input and output is sent back and forth directly through a binary channel, and control messages
//! are sent through a multiplexed text channel.

// Implementation note: this module manages the WebSocket, which is created for us by Actix, and
// Actix works with 'actors' - individual entities that can send each other different message types
// and take action as desired.  Their message handlers aren't async, so you won't see async/await
// here.  The 'child' module manages the child process, and for simplicity of communication between
// the WebSocket actors and the child, it's not async either - it uses standard threads and
// channels.  See its docs for more detail.
