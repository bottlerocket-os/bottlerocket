# Both containers are disabled by default in off-AWS variants because the user
# must supply user data in order to use the containers.  The admin container
# isn't useful without SSH keys/CA certs, and the control container can only be
# used with hybrid SSM off of AWS.  Users of off-AWS variants might not want to
# use either of those options.
