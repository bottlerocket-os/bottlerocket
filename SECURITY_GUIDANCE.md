# Security Guidance

## Overview

Bottlerocket adheres to the [Shared Responsibility Model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/) which defines security and compliance as a shared responsibility between the OS vendor and the customer.

We provide these recommendations, along with [details](#details) and [examples](#examples), to help you create a configuration that meets your security and compliance requirements.

## Details

### Enable automatic updates

Bottlerocket includes many [security features](SECURITY_FEATURES.md) to mitigate software vulnerabilities.
These countermeasures serve to reduce the reliability of exploits and to raise their cost.
However, it is always better to patch vulnerabilities than to rely on mitigations alone.

For our Kubernetes variants, we provide [a Kubernetes operator](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-update-operator) for automated updates to Bottlerocket.
We recommend deploying it on your Kubernetes clusters.

For our ECS variant, we provide [an updater](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-ecs-updater) for automated updates to Bottlerocket.
We recommend deploying it on your ECS clusters.

### Avoid containers with elevated privileges

Containers can be made more secure by limiting the capabilities they have, by filtering syscalls they can make, and by changing the SELinux labels they use.

Capabilities are a way to split up the traditional powers of the `root` user so that a subset of the permissions can be granted instead.
For example, `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` can be granted to allow binding to a low-numbered port.
Bottlerocket uses `runc` to execute containers with [a subset of Linux capabilities](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/blob/master/libcontainer/SPEC.md#security).

Syscalls are a way for userspace programs to request services from the kernel.
Seccomp filters can be used to allow access to a subset of syscalls.
Bottlerocket uses `containerd` as the container runtime which provides [a default seccomp profile](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/master/contrib/seccomp/seccomp_default.go).

SELinux labels are part of mandatory access controls, which impose constraints after discretionary access controls are checked.
Bottlerocket runs unprivileged containers with the restrictive `container_t` label.

Orchestrators provide ways to disable these protections:
* Docker can run containers with the `--privileged` flag
* Kubernetes can run pods with `privileged: true` in the pod definition
* Amazon ECS can run tasks with `"privileged": true` in the task definition

By default, Kubernetes also runs pods with no seccomp filter applied.
Pods can specify a seccomp profile, or you can apply a default profile using a [Pod Security Policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/).

We recommend that you avoid containers with elevated privileges.
The default set of capabilities, the default seccomp filter, and the default SELinux labels should be used where possible.

### Restrict access to the host API socket

The Bottlerocket API server listens for requests on a Unix domain socket.
The canonical location of this socket is `/run/api.sock`.
It is owned by UID 0 (`root`) and GID 274 (`api`).
It is labeled `api_socket_t`, so only processes with privileged SELinux labels can use it.

Write access to this socket will grant full control over system configuration.
This includes the ability to define an arbitrary source for a host container, and to run that container with "superpowers" that bypass other restrictions.
These "superpowers" are described [below](#limit-use-of-host-containers).
For Kubernetes variants, it also includes the ability to define and run static pods.
These are managed directly by `kubelet` and are not subject to admission controllers that enforce security policies for the cluster.

We recommend blocking access to the API socket from containers managed by the orchestrator.
The "control" host container can be used to modify settings when needed.

### Restrict access to the container runtime socket

Different [variants](variants/) of Bottlerocket may have different container runtimes installed.
Each container runtime will have its own API and will listen for requests on a Unix domain socket.
The socket will usually be owned by UID 0 (`root`) and GID 0 (`root`).

Some potential locations of container runtime sockets are:
* `/run/docker.sock`
* `/run/dockershim.sock`
* `/run/containerd/containerd.sock`
* `/run/host-containerd/host-containerd.sock`

Write access to any of these sockets will grant full control over container execution.
This includes the ability to run containers with elevated privileges and with access to all filesystem locations.

One common use case for mounting the container runtime socket is to perform container image builds.
Instead of mounting the socket, you can use an image build tool that does not require additional privileges.

We recommend blocking access to the container runtime socket from containers managed by the orchestrator.

### Design for host replacement

One of the main security objectives of Bottlerocket is to harden the OS against persistent threats.
This is closely related to the support for automated, in-place updates.
Applying updates to the same host makes sense if you are confident that the underlying software can still be trusted.

However, containers share the same kernel with the host.
The exposed kernel interface can be minimized through techniques such as seccomp filters, but it cannot be eliminated.
If the kernel is ever compromised through a local exploit, then other defenses may break down.

We recommend designing for periodic host replacement even with automated updates enabled.

### Enable kernel lockdown

The security mechanisms in Bottlerocket ultimately depend on the kernel for enforcement.
This includes access controls such as capabilities and SELinux, and integrity checks such as dm-verity.
Modifications to the running kernel could bypass or subvert these mechanisms.

Bottlerocket enables the Lockdown security module and offers settings to choose from one of three modes.

The first mode, "none", effectively disables the protection.

The second mode, "integrity", blocks most ways to overwrite the kernel's memory and modify its code.
Enabling this mode will prevent unsigned kernel modules from being loaded.

The third mode, "confidentiality", stops most ways of reading the kernel's memory from userspace.
The goal is to protect secrets that may be stored in the kernel, such as keys used to detect modification while the system is offline.
Bottlerocket does not make use of the secrets that this mode is meant to protect.
Enabling this mode will break BPF, perf, and any other tools that rely on reading kernel memory.

We recommend enabling kernel lockdown in "integrity" mode.

### Limit use of host containers

Bottlerocket offers host containers to provide out-of-band access to the underlying host OS.

Host containers can be configured with an optional `superpowered` flag.
This causes the container to run with extra privileges, an unrestricted SELinux label, and additional mounts.
The current implementation can be found in [host-ctr](sources/host-ctr/cmd/host-ctr/main.go).

Two host containers are defined in the default configuration.
The ["control" host container](README.md#control-container) is enabled by default unless otherwise specified.
It provides remote connectivity through the AWS SSM [Session Manager](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/session-manager/sessions).
The ["admin" host container](README.md#admin-container) is disabled by default unless otherwise specified.
It can be enabled through the "control" host container, through instance user data, or by accessing the host API socket.

We recommend leaving the "admin" host container disabled until it is necessary to use it.
The "control" host container can also be disabled if you are confident you will not need it.
**This could leave you with no way to access the API and change settings on an existing node!**

If you define your own host container, avoid using `superpowered = true` unless your use case requires an extremely high level of privilege, such as loading an out-of-tree kernel module.

### Limit use of privileged SELinux labels

Bottlerocket enables SELinux in enforcing mode by default.
SELinux works by associating labels with subjects (processes) and objects (such as files).

Labels are "sticky" by default: processes will receive the label of their parent process, and files will receive the label of the directory where they are created.
A process can change its own label or the label of a child process under certain circumstances.
These changes are called "transitions".
The SELinux policy for Bottlerocket defines special transition rules for container runtimes.

A container runtime can transition a child processes to any of these labels:
* `container_t` (the default for ordinary containers)
* `control_t` (the default for privileged containers)
* `super_t` (opt-in for "superpowered" containers)

The `control_t` and `super_t` labels allow writes to the API socket.
The `super_t` label allows modifications to any file or directory on the host OS.

Some orchestrators allow SELinux labels to be defined in the container specification, including Kubernetes and Amazon ECS.
If `control_t` or `super_t` is specified in this way, it will override the default transition rules and the container will run with additional privileges.

We recommend limiting access to any SELinux label other than `container_t`.

### Limit access to system mounts

Bottlerocket provides a read-only root filesystem, ephemeral mounts for system directories such as `/etc` and `/run`, and persistent storage under `/local`.

The `/etc` directory contains system configuration files generated by the API.
These are regenerated when a setting changes, but otherwise not monitored.
If the contents of this directory are mounted into a privileged container, they can be modified in unexpected ways.
This is not supported and may interfere with the reliability of automated updates.

The `/run` directory contains ephemeral files such as Unix domain sockets used by the API server and the container runtime.
If the contents of this directory are mounted into a privileged container, they can be used to bypass security protections.

The `/local` directory is where persistent storage is mounted, with `/var` and `/opt` as subdirectories.
This is where cached container images, unpacked container layers, and files for host containers are stored.
If this directory or its subdirectories are mounted into a privileged container, the integrity of the system can be compromised.

We recommend limiting access to all system mounts.

### Limit access to host namespaces

Namespaces are one of the key building blocks for Linux containers.

Network namespaces provide isolation for network resources such as IP addresses, ports, and routing tables.
Containers that share the host network namespace can connect to services listening on the host loopback addresses `127.0.0.1` and `::1`.
These services are not otherwise reachable from the network.

Sharing the network namespace also enables access to abstract sockets.
Containers that share the host network namespace can send messages to processes on the host which expose APIs over abstract sockets.
This can bypass intended restrictions for API access.

PID namespaces provide isolation for the process ID number space.
Containers that share the host PID namespace can interact with processes running on the host.
This includes the ability to send signals to those processes, which may interfere with system functionality.

Sharing the host PID namespace also enables access to the host filesystem through `/proc/<pid>/root` links for host processes.
This can bypass intended restrictions for system mounts.

We recommend limiting access to all host namespaces.

### Limit access to block devices

Direct access to block devices can be used to bypass abstractions such as filesystems and caches.
This is useful for databases and storage applications that want full control over the data layout on disk.

The order in which the kernel enumerates block devices is inconsistent and subject to change.
To avoid referring to the wrong device, Linux distributions use links under `/dev/disk` to map predictable identifiers to specific devices.
Bottlerocket relies on partition type GUIDs and partition names to discover its devices.

Orchestrators offer ways to associate block devices with containers.
For example, Kubernetes allows pods to claim a "block mode" volume and mount the device to a desired path.
Containers with direct access to a block device can alter the partition table or modify the filesystem metadata.
If the same partition type or partition name is used for another device, the `/dev/disk` link may point to the wrong device.
This could compromise the integrity of the host.

We recommend limiting access to block devices.

### Do not run containers as UID 0

Bottlerocket does not currently support user namespaces.
This means that UID 0 (`root`) inside the container is the same as UID 0 on the host.

A process in a container that runs as UID 0 will have nearly unlimited access to the host if all of these are true:
* it uses a privileged SELinux label
* it has access to system mounts
* it shares the host namespaces
* it has elevated privileges, with all capabilities and no seccomp filter

This is essentially the configuration that is used for a host container with "superpowers", where `superpowered = true` is set.

We recommend that you do not run containers as UID 0.

## Examples

### Amazon EC2

These settings can passed as [user data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html) on EC2 instance launch.
They apply to any Bottlerocket variant.

```toml
# Enable kernel lockdown in "integrity" mode.
# This prevents modifications to the running kernel, even by privileged users.
[settings.kernel]
lockdown = "integrity"

# The admin host container provides SSH access and runs with "superpowers".
# It is disabled by default, but can be disabled explicitly.
[settings.host-containers.admin]
enabled = false

# The control host container provides out-of-band access via SSM.
# It is enabled by default, and can be disabled if you do not expect to use SSM.
# This could leave you with no way to access the API and change settings on an existing node!
[settings.host-containers.control]
enabled = false
```

### Amazon ECS

These settings can passed as [user data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html) on EC2 instance launch.
They are specific to the `aws-ecs-1` variant.

```toml
# By default, this variant does not allow launching privileged containers.
# The feature can also be disabled explicitly.
[settings.ecs]
allow-privileged-containers = false
```

### NVIDIA GPU Time-Slicing: Activation Guidelines

Bottlerocket supports NVIDIA GPU time-slicing, enabling system administrators to allocate a set of replicas for a GPU, which can be assigned to individual pods for running various workloads. Internally, GPU time-slicing is used to multiplex workloads from multiple replicas of the same underlying GPU, providing each process with an equal share of time across all pods.

It's worth noting that while time-slicing allows sharing of GPUs among multiple workloads, it does not provide memory or fault isolation between replicas. Without memory isolation, all workloads share the same memory space, which can lead to contention and possible interference between processes. This can affect the predictability and performance of each workload, as one process may consume more resources than anticipated, leaving less available for others and can lead to memory starvation. Moreover, without fault tolerant, if one process fails or behaves maliciously, it has the potential to affect all other processes running on the GPU, posing a security risk.

We recommend to keep NVIDIA GPU time-slicing feature in a disabled state and only enable it when necessary, ensuring that all the workloads sharing the GPU are secure and reliable. For more detailed information, please refer to the [NVIDIA time-slice](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/gpu-sharing.html) documentation.
