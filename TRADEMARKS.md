# TRADEMARK POLICY

Updated April 13, 2023

This Policy provides guidelines for use of the "Bottlerocket" name and logos (the "Bottlerocket Trademarks") to identify the Bottlerocket software.
Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates ("Amazon") strives to be a steward of the Bottlerocket brand for the entire Bottlerocket Community and is the owner of the Bottlerocket Trademarks.
As such, the law obligates us to police and protect the trademarks.
Therefore, we require use of the Bottlerocket Trademarks to be in accordance with this Policy.
Indeed, Amazon’s own use is designed to be consistent with this Policy.

Our goal is to ensure, on behalf of the Bottlerocket Community, that the Bottlerocket Trademark remain reliable indicators of quality and security while also permitting community members, software distributors and others to discuss Bottlerocket and to accurately describe their products’ affiliation with Bottlerocket or the Bottlerocket Community, as well as exercise their rights given Bottlerocket’s open source nature.
Note that this Policy only applies to use of the Bottlerocket Trademarks.

## Overall Guidelines

You may use the Bottlerocket Trademarks to refer to the Bottlerocket software provided that your use is in compliance with this Policy.
Any other use of the Bottlerocket Trademarks requires prior written permission.
Overall, your use of the Bottlerocket Trademarks must not be confusing, misleading, false, or damaging to the Bottlerocket software, the Bottlerocket Community or to the Bottlerocket Trademarks themselves.

People should always know who they are dealing with, and where the software they are downloading and using came from.
You may not use the Bottlerocket Trademarks in any manner that implies approval or endorsement by, or association with, the Bottlerocket project or the Bottlerocket Community.
When using the Bottlerocket Trademarks, your branding should be distinguishable from Bottlerocket trade dress.

You may not use the Bottlerocket Trademarks in a manner that may diminish or otherwise damage the goodwill in the Bottlerocket Trademarks.
The "Bottlerocket" word mark should be used in its exact form, and not abbreviated or combined with any other word or words (e.g., "Bottlerocket" software rather than "BTLRKT" or "Bottlerocket-ified").
Similarly, the Bottlerocket logos should not be modified or integrated with your logos or other designs.
You may create a lockup with your logo and a Bottlerocket logo side by side so long as your logo is not confusingly similar to the Bottlerocket logo and appears first and so long as your use complies with this policy.

Your use of the Bottlerocket Trademarks does not transfer rights in the trademarks or goodwill to you.

## Uses that do not require permission

Provided your use complies with this Policy, you may use the Bottlerocket logos to link to the Bottlerocket website, to indicate that your software or service uses the Bottlerocket software, in architecture diagrams to show how your software or service integrates with Bottlerocket, and in presentations, social media posts (but not as your account image or avatar), whitepapers, blog posts, and similar content as a reference to the Bottlerocket project itself.
It should be clear what role the Bottlerocket project or software plays in the context of your software or services.
The Bottlerocket logos should not be more prominent than your own branding.

Use the official versions of the Bottlerocket logos available for download [here](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61023959?s=200&v=4).
You may transform the file format itself for ease of use and modify the colors.

Provided your use complies with this Policy, you may use the "Bottlerocket" word mark to accurately reference the Bottlerocket software, including on your website, in presentations and publications, at events, in advertising and marketing material, etc., for commercial and noncommercial purposes.
You may use the "Bottlerocket" word mark and any logos we placed on the software in connection with a redistribution of an official distribution of the Bottlerocket software that has not been modified or changed in any way.

Those taking full advantage of the open source nature of the Bottlerocket code may make modifications in accordance with the applicable open source license of Bottlerocket.
You may use the "Bottlerocket" word mark to refer to your modified version of Bottlerocket provided (a) you include an additional identifier indicating you as the source of the modified version (e.g., "Foocorp’s Bottlerocket Derivative"), (b) you clearly identify your modifications and indicate you are the source of the modifications, (c) your use does not suggest any affiliation between Bottlerocket or the Bottlerocket Community and you or your modified version of Bottlerocket, and (d) your use of the "Bottlerocket" word mark should not be more prominent than your additional identifier.

Those taking advantage of the open source nature of the Bottlerocket code may also offer services for, or software that works with, Bottlerocket or modified versions of Bottlerocket, such as cloud management services.
Users should not be confused as to the source of your software or services. With that in mind, you may use the "Bottlerocket" word mark to refer to services for, or software that works with, Bottlerocket or modified versions of Bottlerocket provided (a) you include an additional identifier indicating you as the source of the software or services (e.g., "Foocorp’s Bottlerocket Tool" or "Foocorp Bottlerocket Service"), (b) if your services or software works with a modified version of Bottlerocket, you clearly identify the modifications and indicate the source of the modifications, (c) your use does not suggest any affiliation between Bottlerocket or the Bottlerocket Community and you or your work, and (d) your use of the "Bottlerocket" mark should not be more prominent than your additional identifier.

You may also use the "Bottlerocket" word mark to make accurate statements about compatibility and interoperability using relational phrases such as "works with," "runs on," "compatible with," and the like (e.g., "Foocorp Software powered by Bottlerocket" or "Foocorp Software for Bottlerocket" or "Foocorp Software with Bottlerocket compatibility").

## FAQ

**1. Can I create and redistribute my own builds of Bottlerocket?**

If you build Bottlerocket from unmodified source and redistribute the results, you may use "Bottlerocket" only if it is clear in both the name of your distribution and the content associated with it that your distribution is your build of Bottlerocket and not the official build, and you must identify the commit from which it is built, including the commit date.

**2. What OS changes do I need to make to a modified version of Bottlerocket to comply with this Policy?**

You must modify the os-release file to either use Bottlerocket according to this Policy or to remove the Bottlerocket Trademarks. This can be done by modifying both `packages/release/release.spec` and `tools/rpm2img`. Names of the system root (e.g. `/x86_64-bottlerocket-linux-gnu/sys-root`), partition labels, directory paths, and service file descriptions do not need to be changed to comply with this Policy.

**3. What can I do if I see abuse of the Bottlerocket Trademarks?**

If you are aware of confusing or misleading use or other misuse of the Bottlerocket Trademarks, you may contact us as described above at trademarks@amazon.com so we can investigate further.

**4. This Policy requires modifications and their source to be identified for modified versions of Bottlerocket, where should I put this information?**

You may put this information in any location that is commonly used to convey differences from an upstream open source project, such as a NOTICE text or end-user documentation.
